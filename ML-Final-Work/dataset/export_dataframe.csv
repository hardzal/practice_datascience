Open Cosmos are revolutionising space technology and opening up the cosmos to everyone. Our simple, affordable satellite missions give organisations the chance to use space technology as a tool to get your ideas into orbit. Our mission is to make the leaps in space that become the leaps on Earth.
The People
Compiled of 50+ people from over 15 nationalities, we have a culturally diverse workforce full of Engineers, Software Developers, Business developers and Mission Managers! Beyond the office, we have bakers, long distance runners, climbers, rowers, golfers and mixed martial artists!

Participate in software architecture design
Lead the design and implementation of new back-end modules
Help build and maintain reliable CI/CD with automated testing
Work with our satellite operators to improve their user experience
Input to the technical roadmap

Experience in integrating development operations & developer experience tools
Commitment and a proactive attitude, always seek continuous improvement
Quick to learn and coach others, excited to learn new technologies
Be a teamplayer, always speak your mind honestly and respectfully when there is a problem to solve, so that the team discussion is healthy and productive
Constantly try to strike a good balance in determining what to build depending on the current context and the company's mission and long term goals

Nice to have  

Experience working with Kubernetes and GKE would be highly valued
Experience with space systems
Experience with space links, encoding and modulation

What our devs say...
Henry, Tech Team Lead - “It’s an exciting time to join Bark in many ways but especially from a tech point of view, because we’re at the beginning of the biggest architectural transition in the company's history. As we transition from a startup to a much larger company, we need to upgrade our stack from a few monolith systems, to much more scalable, maintainable, decoupled services.”
George, Developer - “Working so closely with the product and design teams gives me an opportunity to get involved in the product from the earliest stage. Each week we build a new experiment which is a true collaboration of the ideas from everyone in the group. Due to the scale of Bark as a business, it’s also hugely rewarding to see that the work we produce can make a massive impact, by generating millions of pounds in annualised revenue.”
Tom, Senior Product Designer - “There's a real sense of camaraderie across the company. The tech side of the business is really exciting at the moment – we broke into different teams and the effect is phenomenal. Never a dull moment, and feels like we're making real measurable change to the product for our users!”

About Us
We've named our practice Valve+Meter because the variables we can manage with you are the flow and cost of new business. The ""valve"" part of our approach manages the right rate of new business for your operation, and we set our pricing with you not based on the activities we pursue but on the ""metered"" results we generate.
Mission
We exist to change the way businesses approach marketing by delivering abundance and accountability with a customer cost per acquisition strategy.

Senior Software Engineer,Teamshares,Full Time,Remote,5 days ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/f2364a48-c145-40ba-9d69-5967b49333b7,"
WHAT IS TEAMSHARES?
Teamshares helps small businesses become employee-owned. You can think of us as a hybrid of a software company, an investment company, an education company, and a support network.
WHY WE EXIST:
Teamshares’ mission to expand employee ownership addresses three major problems for small businesses that make up 98% of US firms in our economy, and their employees:

Most small businesses don’t outlast their founder. When original owners want to retire, they often struggle to sell—failing 80% of the time—and have to fold the company. Years of knowledge and customer loyalty, not to mention people’s jobs, are lost. We believe that employees are the natural successors for these companies, but they just need some support.
The majority of Americans have very few assets or savings. People work hard every day, often with very little to show for it: 75% of Americans have less than $5,000 in savings. Employee ownership gives workers a very valuable asset: stock in the company where they work. And the better their company does, the more their asset is worth!
Small businesses lack support & innovation. Because small businesses lack the infrastructure and resources that corporations have, their technology and their business practices are often behind the times. Very few quality networks exist to provide information or resources to small businesses to help them grow.

There hasn’t been an easy way for small businesses to become employee-owned before. Teamshares has designed a way to make this transition easier at scale, supporting a sector of the economy that has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
WHAT YOU WILL DO:

Collaborate with product, design, and business ops teams to build software that addresses these unique problems:

Identifying, evaluating, and acquiring companies that best fit our model
Creating the preeminent management system and software for how small businesses should operate and self-govern
Building digital education experiences that teach financial fluency and make employee-ownership tangible and actionable


Drive technical architecture decisions that lay the foundation of our digital products for years to come
Solve problems with a measurable impact: we’re helping thousands of low/mid-income employees across America earn 5-6 figure ownership stakes through our model of participatory capitalism

WHAT YOU BRING:

3+ years experience developing user-facing features in a modern web stack (Ruby on Rails strongly preferred)
An empathetic approach to and passion for solving customer problems. You’re able to think in terms of product, not just code.
A creative, entrepreneurial mindset. You love jumping into new problem spaces and figuring out the right solution.

WHY JOIN US?
We believe in supporting every team member with a generous benefits package:

Competitive salary
Equity
Exceptional medical, dental, and vision benefits plans
401k plan
Paid parental leave
We value time off and actually take our vacations
Healthy work-life balance culture that checks egos at the door and truly unplugs at the end of the day
Support for ongoing training and development

We’re remote-first

Our 18-person team is spread all across the country—you can live and work anywhere you like.

We’re committed to our core values

Trust comes first
Take initiative
Act thoughtfully
Show empathy
Make things better
Be dependable

Helping us scale our applications and infrastructure 125x what it can handle now, while making it faster and more robust.
Working on our Medical AI Tool suite like our Data lake and our globally deployed annotation application, such that we can increase our development velocity, and product quality.
Constantly improving our CI/CD, so we can ensure the quality of our product

There are two factors that make the above especially challenging:

We work with large files, and resource heavy workloads, meaning that we have to invest a lot in optimisation and cost control.
We are a medical software manufacturer, meaning we comply with the highest standards of software development. This means we have an extensive CI/CD process that has to assure that our AI performs as it should on a wide variety of cases.

Henry, Tech Team Lead - “It’s an exciting time to join Bark in many ways but especially from a tech point of view, because we’re at the beginning of the biggest architectural transition in the company's history.

George, Developer - “Working so closely with the product and design teams gives me an opportunity to get involved in the product from the earliest stage. Each week we build a new experiment which is a true collaboration of the ideas from everyone in the group. Due to the scale of Bark as a business, it’s also hugely rewarding to see that the work we produce can make a massive impact, by generating millions of pounds in annualised revenue.”
Tom, Senior Product Designer - “There's a real sense of camaraderie across the company. The tech side of the business is really exciting at the moment – we broke into different teams and the effect is phenomenal. Never a dull moment, and feels like we're making real measurable change to the product for our users!”

Test all new and existing sites for performance, scalability and browser compatibility.
Ensure compliance with all coding standards and web accessibility.
Stay up to date on the latest community trends and make recommendations to the team.

About Us
We've named our practice Valve+Meter because the variables we can manage with you are the flow and cost of new business. The ""valve"" part of our approach manages the right rate of new business for your operation, and we set our pricing with you not based on the activities we pursue but on the ""metered"" results we generate.
Mission
We exist to change the way businesses approach marketing by delivering abundance and accountability with a customer cost per acquisition strategy.
Vision
We inspire businesses to look at marketing as a revenue center rather than a cost center.

Senior Software Engineer,Teamshares,Full Time,Remote,5 days ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/f2364a48-c145-40ba-9d69-5967b49333b7,"
WHAT IS TEAMSHARES?
Teamshares helps small businesses become employee-owned. You can think of us as a hybrid of a software company, an investment company, an education company, and a support network.
WHY WE EXIST:
Teamshares’ mission to expand employee ownership addresses three major problems for small businesses that make up 98% of US firms in our economy, and their employees:

Most small businesses don’t outlast their founder. When original owners want to retire, they often struggle to sell—failing 80% of the time—and have to fold the company. Years of knowledge and customer loyalty, not to mention people’s jobs, are lost. We believe that employees are the natural successors for these companies, but they just need some support.
The majority of Americans have very few assets or savings. People work hard every day, often with very little to show for it: 75% of Americans have less than $5,000 in savings. Employee ownership gives workers a very valuable asset: stock in the company where they work. And the better their company does, the more their asset is worth!
Small businesses lack support & innovation. Because small businesses lack the infrastructure and resources that corporations have, their technology and their business practices are often behind the times. Very few quality networks exist to provide information or resources to small businesses to help them grow.

There hasn’t been an easy way for small businesses to become employee-owned before. Teamshares has designed a way to make this transition easier at scale, supporting a sector of the economy that has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
WHAT YOU WILL DO:

Collaborate with product, design, and business ops teams to build software that addresses these unique problems:

Identifying, evaluating, and acquiring companies that best fit our model
Creating the preeminent management system and software for how small businesses should operate and self-govern
Building digital education experiences that teach financial fluency and make employee-ownership tangible and actionable


Drive technical architecture decisions that lay the foundation of our digital products for years to come
Solve problems with a measurable impact: we’re helping thousands of low/mid-income employees across America earn 5-6 figure ownership stakes through our model of participatory capitalism

WHAT YOU BRING:

3+ years experience developing user-facing features in a modern web stack (Ruby on Rails strongly preferred)
An empathetic approach to and passion for solving customer problems. You’re able to think in terms of product, not just code.
A creative, entrepreneurial mindset. You love jumping into new problem spaces and figuring out the right solution.

WHY JOIN US?
We believe in supporting every team member with a generous benefits package:

Competitive salary
Equity
Exceptional medical, dental, and vision benefits plans
401k plan
Paid parental leave
We value time off and actually take our vacations
Healthy work-life balance culture that checks egos at the door and truly unplugs at the end of the day
Support for ongoing training and development

We’re remote-first

Our 18-person team is spread all across the country—you can live and work anywhere you like.

We’re committed to our core values

Trust comes first
Take initiative
Act thoughtfully
Show empathy
Make things better
Be dependable

What our devs say...
Henry, Tech Team Lead - “It’s an exciting time to join Bark in many ways but especially from a tech point of view, because we’re at the beginning of the biggest architectural transition in the company's history. As we transition from a startup to a much larger company, we need to upgrade our stack from a few monolith systems, to much more scalable, maintainable, decoupled services.”
George, Developer - “Working so closely with the product and design teams gives me an opportunity to get involved in the product from the earliest stage. Each week we build a new experiment which is a true collaboration of the ideas from everyone in the group. Due to the scale of Bark as a business, it’s also hugely rewarding to see that the work we produce can make a massive impact, by generating millions of pounds in annualised revenue.”
Tom, Senior Product Designer - “There's a real sense of camaraderie across the company. The tech side of the business is really exciting at the moment – we broke into different teams and the effect is phenomenal. Never a dull moment, and feels like we're making real measurable change to the product for our users!”

Our mission is to make it easy for teachers to create interactive games and worksheets for their students. Our site automates the process of resource design, so teachers can simply enter the content that is appropriate for their class – a list of keywords, definitions, questions or images. Wordwall produces the content in over 60 different templates; for example, gameshow quizzes, crosswords, labelled diagrams and arcade games. It seeks to disrupt the publisher-driven model of paid-for “professionally” made educational content, by putting high-quality content creation in the hands of teachers and making that teacher-made content, freely accessible through our online community.
We are a small team with big ambitions, who work remotely across the world. Our 15 million monthly users are rapidly proliferating. We’ve got a product that works and we’re building for the long-term. We want people who want to stick around, grow with us and help make games-based learning accessible to all.
Technologies we use: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Canvas API, WebAudio API, C#, ASP.NET MVC, MS-SQL, Azure, Selenium, TeamCity CD
We are an equal opportunities employer. We support flexible working arrangements - full or part time.
Real applicants only - please do not contact us if you represent an agency.
Requirements:

Excellent C# & JScript skills
Minimum 3 years experience working within a software development team
Able to self-organise and motivate when working remotely

This role reports to the Director of Digital Marketing.

Test all new and existing sites for performance, scalability and browser compatibility.
Ensure compliance with all coding standards and web accessibility.
Stay up to date on the latest community trends and make recommendations to the team.

About Us
We've named our practice Valve+Meter because the variables we can manage with you are the flow and cost of new business. The ""valve"" part of our approach manages the right rate of new business for your operation, and we set our pricing with you not based on the activities we pursue but on the ""metered"" results we generate.
Mission
We exist to change the way businesses approach marketing by delivering abundance and accountability with a customer cost per acquisition strategy.
Vision
We inspire businesses to look at marketing as a revenue center rather than a cost center.
Core Values

Think: Focus. Find a way forward.
Love: Act in the long-term best interest of another.
Serve: Meet expectations. Go the extra mile.
Transform: Create dramatic change. Be irreplaceable.

Senior Software Engineer,Teamshares,Full Time,Remote,5 days ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/f2364a48-c145-40ba-9d69-5967b49333b7,"
WHAT IS TEAMSHARES?
Teamshares helps small businesses become employee-owned. You can think of us as a hybrid of a software company, an investment company, an education company, and a support network.
WHY WE EXIST:
Teamshares’ mission to expand employee ownership addresses three major problems for small businesses that make up 98% of US firms in our economy, and their employees:

Most small businesses don’t outlast their founder. When original owners want to retire, they often struggle to sell—failing 80% of the time—and have to fold the company. Years of knowledge and customer loyalty, not to mention people’s jobs, are lost. We believe that employees are the natural successors for these companies, but they just need some support.
The majority of Americans have very few assets or savings. People work hard every day, often with very little to show for it: 75% of Americans have less than $5,000 in savings. Employee ownership gives workers a very valuable asset: stock in the company where they work. And the better their company does, the more their asset is worth!
Small businesses lack support & innovation. Because small businesses lack the infrastructure and resources that corporations have, their technology and their business practices are often behind the times. Very few quality networks exist to provide information or resources to small businesses to help them grow.

There hasn’t been an easy way for small businesses to become employee-owned before. Teamshares has designed a way to make this transition easier at scale, supporting a sector of the economy that has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
WHAT YOU WILL DO:

Collaborate with product, design, and business ops teams to build software that addresses these unique problems:

Identifying, evaluating, and acquiring companies that best fit our model
Creating the preeminent management system and software for how small businesses should operate and self-govern
Building digital education experiences that teach financial fluency and make employee-ownership tangible and actionable


Drive technical architecture decisions that lay the foundation of our digital products for years to come
Solve problems with a measurable impact: we’re helping thousands of low/mid-income employees across America earn 5-6 figure ownership stakes through our model of participatory capitalism

WHAT YOU BRING:

3+ years experience developing user-facing features in a modern web stack (Ruby on Rails strongly preferred)
An empathetic approach to and passion for solving customer problems. You’re able to think in terms of product, not just code.
A creative, entrepreneurial mindset. You love jumping into new problem spaces and figuring out the right solution.

WHY JOIN US?
We believe in supporting every team member with a generous benefits package:

Competitive salary
Equity
Exceptional medical, dental, and vision benefits plans
401k plan
Paid parental leave
We value time off and actually take our vacations
Healthy work-life balance culture that checks egos at the door and truly unplugs at the end of the day
Support for ongoing training and development

We’re remote-first

Our 18-person team is spread all across the country—you can live and work anywhere you like.

We’re committed to our core values

Trust comes first
Take initiative
Act thoughtfully
Show empathy
Make things better
Be dependable

Senior Backend Engineer
About the role
We are looking for a Senior Engineer to join our new backend services team. You’ll become a core part of a small, dynamic team that is breaking new ground: researching, designing and implementing the future technology at Bark. You’ll be someone who loves innovating and problem solving, and gets a kick out of making systems work efficiently at a continuously-increasing large scale.
Our current back-end technology stack is written in Python and you will need to be able to work within this codebase - but we are at the start of a journey, and your experience will help to shape our technology strategy, adapting our architecture as we grow.
You’ll get the opportunity to utilise a variety of technologies to pave the future of Bark whilst enhancing how we solve complex online problems in cutting-edge areas such as search, classification and core marketplace services. You’ll be involved in every aspect of the process: idea generation, business analysis, technical and architectural design through to implementation.
Some of our benefits:

Competitive salary.
Share options in a rapidly growing company, whose founders have a proven track record of successful exits.
Private gym, just for Bark employees.
Private health insurance.
Monthly socials and massive parties.
Fully stocked kitchen and weekly team lunches.

Responsibilities:

Work with development teams and product managers to conceptualise and implement software solutions.
Build elegant and performant APIs
Develop and manage well-functioning databases and applications.
Proactively propose and implement improvements to the codebase.
Design and code solutions for systems with 1000s of transactions a second.

Understand SOLID principles.

Knowledge of Apache Airflow, Spark, Hadoop and other data toolkits.
Experience with other data stores like Elastic, MongoDB or similar.
Interest in machine learning topics such as logistic regression, nlp and others.
PHP experience with a framework (Laravel, Symfony, Zend, CakePHP etc) would be a bonus, but not essential.

What our devs say...
Henry, Tech Team Lead - “It’s an exciting time to join Bark in many ways but especially from a tech point of view, because we’re at the beginning of the biggest architectural transition in the company's history. As we transition from a startup to a much larger company, we need to upgrade our stack from a few monolith systems, to much more scalable, maintainable, decoupled services.”
George, Developer - “Working so closely with the product and design teams gives me an opportunity to get involved in the product from the earliest stage. Each week we build a new experiment which is a true collaboration of the ideas from everyone in the group. Due to the scale of Bark as a business, it’s also hugely rewarding to see that the work we produce can make a massive impact, by generating millions of pounds in annualised revenue.”
Tom, Senior Product Designer - “There's a real sense of camaraderie across the company. The tech side of the business is really exciting at the moment – we broke into different teams and the effect is phenomenal. Never a dull moment, and feels like we're making real measurable change to the product for our users!”

We’ve got a product that works and we’re building for the long-term. We want people who want to stick around, grow with us and help make games-based learning accessible to all.

Test all new and existing sites for performance, scalability and browser compatibility.
Ensure compliance with all coding standards and web accessibility.
Stay up to date on the latest community trends and make recommendations to the team.

About Us
We've named our practice Valve+Meter because the variables we can manage with you are the flow and cost of new business. The ""valve"" part of our approach manages the right rate of new business for your operation, and we set our pricing with you not based on the activities we pursue but on the ""metered"" results we generate.
Mission
We exist to change the way businesses approach marketing by delivering abundance and accountability with a customer cost per acquisition strategy.
Vision
We inspire businesses to look at marketing as a revenue center rather than a cost center.
Core Values

Senior Software Engineer,Teamshares,Full Time,Remote,5 days ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/f2364a48-c145-40ba-9d69-5967b49333b7,"
WHAT IS TEAMSHARES?
Teamshares helps small businesses become employee-owned. You can think of us as a hybrid of a software company, an investment company, an education company, and a support network.
WHY WE EXIST:
Teamshares’ mission to expand employee ownership addresses three major problems for small businesses that make up 98% of US firms in our economy, and their employees:

Most small businesses don’t outlast their founder. When original owners want to retire, they often struggle to sell—failing 80% of the time—and have to fold the company. Years of knowledge and customer loyalty, not to mention people’s jobs, are lost. We believe that employees are the natural successors for these companies, but they just need some support.
The majority of Americans have very few assets or savings. People work hard every day, often with very little to show for it: 75% of Americans have less than $5,000 in savings. Employee ownership gives workers a very valuable asset: stock in the company where they work. And the better their company does, the more their asset is worth!
Small businesses lack support & innovation. Because small businesses lack the infrastructure and resources that corporations have, their technology and their business practices are often behind the times. Very few quality networks exist to provide information or resources to small businesses to help them grow.

There hasn’t been an easy way for small businesses to become employee-owned before. Teamshares has designed a way to make this transition easier at scale, supporting a sector of the economy that has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
WHAT YOU WILL DO:

Collaborate with product, design, and business ops teams to build software that addresses these unique problems:

Identifying, evaluating, and acquiring companies that best fit our model
Creating the preeminent management system and software for how small businesses should operate and self-govern
Building digital education experiences that teach financial fluency and make employee-ownership tangible and actionable


Drive technical architecture decisions that lay the foundation of our digital products for years to come
Solve problems with a measurable impact: we’re helping thousands of low/mid-income employees across America earn 5-6 figure ownership stakes through our model of participatory capitalism

WHAT YOU BRING:

3+ years experience developing user-facing features in a modern web stack (Ruby on Rails strongly preferred)
An empathetic approach to and passion for solving customer problems. You’re able to think in terms of product, not just code.
A creative, entrepreneurial mindset. You love jumping into new problem spaces and figuring out the right solution.

WHY JOIN US?
We believe in supporting every team member with a generous benefits package:

Competitive salary
Equity
Exceptional medical, dental, and vision benefits plans
401k plan
Paid parental leave
We value time off and actually take our vacations
Healthy work-life balance culture that checks egos at the door and truly unplugs at the end of the day
Support for ongoing training and development

We’re remote-first

Our 18-person team is spread all across the country—you can live and work anywhere you like.

We’re committed to our core values

Trust comes first
Take initiative
Act thoughtfully
Show empathy
Make things better
Be dependable

Compiled of 50+ people from over 15 nationalities, we have a culturally diverse workforce full of Engineers, Software Developers, Business developers and Mission Managers! Beyond the office, we have bakers, long distance runners, climbers, rowers, golfers and mixed martial artists!
The Vision
By making space data more accessible and affordable, we want to be the platform that allows applicable solutions to be the prevention, not the cure.  When tragedy strikes, Earth Observation satellites can be used to detect where resources would be most effective and map out the scale of damage to help decision makers rebuild
Description of the Position
You will be joining the Open Cosmos software development team where you will be responsible for designing, implementing, testing, delivering and maintaining several of the software modules of one of our core products: OpenApp Mission Control Software. A satellite constellation control software that is used by internal operators and external customers alike, to operate the constellation of multi-customer, multi-satellite  and multi-ground station missions.
Our product is a cloud-native web-based application built with modern technologies (microservices, kubernetes, golang, etc). We work using a DevOps and Agile methodology, where we combine frequent iteration cycles with the responsibility of keeping the application operative.

Moving forward we will face many challenges that you might help resolve, ranging from new modules such as a scripting solution to allow automation in operations; improve architecture to seemingly support different satellite platforms; increase observability and tracing; or multi-cloud deployments among many others, you will find a project that suits your interests.
Tasks and responsibilities  

Participate in software architecture design
Lead the design and implementation of new back-end modules
Help build and maintain reliable CI/CD with automated testing
Work with our satellite operators to improve their user experience
Input to the technical roadmap

Experience in microservices-based back-end development with Golang.
Experience and knowledge of common ground segment and space standards such as CCSDS, ECSS, CSP, Space Packets, etc.
Experience in integrating development operations & developer experience tools
Commitment and a proactive attitude, always seek continuous improvement
Quick to learn and coach others, excited to learn new technologies
Be a teamplayer, always speak your mind honestly and respectfully when there is a problem to solve, so that the team discussion is healthy and productive
Constantly try to strike a good balance in determining what to build depending on the current context and the company's mission and long term goals

Nice to have  

Experience working with Kubernetes and GKE would be highly valued
Experience with space systems
Experience with space links, encoding and modulation
Experience maintaining and managing SQL databases

Private gym, just for Bark employees.
Private health insurance.

PHP experience with a framework (Laravel, Symfony, Zend, CakePHP etc) would be a bonus, but not essential.

What our devs say...
Henry, Tech Team Lead - “It’s an exciting time to join Bark in many ways but especially from a tech point of view, because we’re at the beginning of the biggest architectural transition in the company's history. As we transition from a startup to a much larger company, we need to upgrade our stack from a few monolith systems, to much more scalable, maintainable, decoupled services.”
George, Developer - “Working so closely with the product and design teams gives me an opportunity to get involved in the product from the earliest stage. Each week we build a new experiment which is a true collaboration of the ideas from everyone in the group. Due to the scale of Bark as a business, it’s also hugely rewarding to see that the work we produce can make a massive impact, by generating millions of pounds in annualised revenue.”
Tom, Senior Product Designer - “There's a real sense of camaraderie across the company. The tech side of the business is really exciting at the moment – we broke into different teams and the effect is phenomenal. Never a dull moment, and feels like we're making real measurable change to the product for our users!”

PGGM en Corona
Door de Corona situatie, werken de meeste PGGM’ers momenteel vanuit huis. Als we met je kennis willen maken, betekent dit dat de interviews grotendeels via videocalls plaatsvinden. Een afrondend gesprek doen we op kantoor. Nemen we je aan? Dan zal het grootste deel van jouw inwerktraject op afstand gebeuren. Hierbij maken we gebruik van Microsoft Teams. Het is beperkt mogelijk om collega’s op kantoor te ontmoeten.
Aan intermediairs
We weten dat er veel partijen zijn die graag met ons mee willen zoeken of hun diensten willen aanbieden voor deze vacature, maar bij PGGM werven we nieuwe collega’s zelf. Acquisitie naar een werving & selectie-opdracht of onaangekondigde aanbiedingen van CV's stellen we dan ook niet op prijs en nemen wij niet in behandeling. Mochten we er niet uitkomen, dan bellen we jou.

We’ve got a product that works and we’re building for the long-term. We want people who want to stick around, grow with us and help make games-based learning accessible to all.

About Us
We've named our practice Valve+Meter because the variables we can manage with you are the flow and cost of new business. The ""valve"" part of our approach manages the right rate of new business for your operation, and we set our pricing with you not based on the activities we pursue but on the ""metered"" results we generate.
Mission
We exist to change the way businesses approach marketing by delivering abundance and accountability with a customer cost per acquisition strategy.

Senior Software Engineer,Teamshares,Full Time,Remote,5 days ago,https://jobs.github.com/positions/f2364a48-c145-40ba-9d69-5967b49333b7,"
WHAT IS TEAMSHARES?
Teamshares helps small businesses become employee-owned. You can think of us as a hybrid of a software company, an investment company, an education company, and a support network.
WHY WE EXIST:
Teamshares’ mission to expand employee ownership addresses three major problems for small businesses that make up 98% of US firms in our economy, and their employees:

Most small businesses don’t outlast their founder. When original owners want to retire, they often struggle to sell—failing 80% of the time—and have to fold the company. Years of knowledge and customer loyalty, not to mention people’s jobs, are lost. We believe that employees are the natural successors for these companies, but they just need some support.
The majority of Americans have very few assets or savings. People work hard every day, often with very little to show for it: 75% of Americans have less than $5,000 in savings. Employee ownership gives workers a very valuable asset: stock in the company where they work. And the better their company does, the more their asset is worth!
Small businesses lack support & innovation. Because small businesses lack the infrastructure and resources that corporations have, their technology and their business practices are often behind the times. Very few quality networks exist to provide information or resources to small businesses to help them grow.

There hasn’t been an easy way for small businesses to become employee-owned before. Teamshares has designed a way to make this transition easier at scale, supporting a sector of the economy that has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
WHAT YOU WILL DO:

Collaborate with product, design, and business ops teams to build software that addresses these unique problems:

Identifying, evaluating, and acquiring companies that best fit our model
Creating the preeminent management system and software for how small businesses should operate and self-govern
Building digital education experiences that teach financial fluency and make employee-ownership tangible and actionable


Drive technical architecture decisions that lay the foundation of our digital products for years to come
Solve problems with a measurable impact: we’re helping thousands of low/mid-income employees across America earn 5-6 figure ownership stakes through our model of participatory capitalism

WHAT YOU BRING:

3+ years experience developing user-facing features in a modern web stack (Ruby on Rails strongly preferred)
An empathetic approach to and passion for solving customer problems. You’re able to think in terms of product, not just code.
A creative, entrepreneurial mindset. You love jumping into new problem spaces and figuring out the right solution.

WHY JOIN US?
We believe in supporting every team member with a generous benefits package:

Competitive salary
Equity
Exceptional medical, dental, and vision benefits plans
401k plan
Paid parental leave
We value time off and actually take our vacations
Healthy work-life balance culture that checks egos at the door and truly unplugs at the end of the day
Support for ongoing training and development

We’re remote-first

Our 18-person team is spread all across the country—you can live and work anywhere you like.

We’re committed to our core values

Trust comes first
Take initiative
Act thoughtfully
Show empathy
Make things better
Be dependable
